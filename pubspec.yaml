  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/image/
    - assets/icon/
     #assets/icon/

  fonts:
    - family: JFFlat     
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/JFFlatRegulr.ttf 
        #- asset: assets/fonts/JFbold.ttf  

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  #fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #    fonts:
  #      - asset: assets/k/JF-Flat-Regular.ttf
  #      - asset: assets/k/JFbold.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
